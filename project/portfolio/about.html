  <h2 class="green-text">A brief overview of my passion</h2>

  <p class="white-text">There is no casino card game that is more exciting and easier to understand than blackjack. Since its introduction in casinos in the twentieth century, the game has increased its popularity to become the favorite casino game
    in the world.</p>
  <span class="white-text"> But before betting on the tables and show off to win big, let me introduce myself
    Im a 25 year old web dev student with a burning passion for the complexity and simplicity blackjack can come to offer for a user. Since a very young age ive dabbled with an affinity for this game due to its mathematical nature. This obsession has
    led me to explore many quaint spots for gamblers in many destinations.</span>
  <h3 class="red-text">Basic Rules</h3>
  <span class="white-text"> In each round of blackjack, players sitting at the table start by placing a bet in their respective betting positions, also known as "boxes". Each table clearly establishes the minimum and maximum bet that each player can
    bet, and the sizes of the bets can be chosen by clicking on the chip icon that represents the correct value of a desired bet. After placing all bets, players will receive two cards face up in front of their boxes, and the bank will receive a card
    (European style) or two cards with one up and one down (Atlantic City style), depending on the variant that is playing</span>
  <p class="white-text">The goal of any blackjack hand is to defeat the bank. For this, you must have a hand that scores higher than the hand of the bank, but does not exceed 21 points in total value. Or, you can win with a score below 22 when the
    hand of the bank exceeds 21 points. When the total value of your hand is 22 or more, this is commonly known as "bankruptcy," and you will automatically lose any money wagered.</p>
  <h2 class="white-text">How to play</h2>
  <p class="white-text">When prompted, you can ask for cards for your hand, to increase the total value. When you have finished adding cards to your hand, the bank will complete your hand. These are strict rules of how to do it, which vary according
    to the blackjack variant you are playing. Make sure you understand the rules of each variant, as it is a fundamental aspect of how blackjack is played and allows you to make important strategic decisions in each hand.
    It is not surprising that the best hand in blackjack is known as "blackjack". The best hand in the game pays more than any other combination (up to 3 to 2 of your bet, depending on the variant you are playing) and is made up of an ace and any
    card with a value of ten, including any jack, queen, king or ten Blackjack must be dealt in the first two cards to be valid and invincible. However, it can be tied if the bank also has blackjack.
    In blackjack, the tens, the jacks, the queens and the kings have a value of 10 each. Aces can have two different values: one or eleven (you can choose which one). For example, when you combine an ace and a four, the hand can be worth 5 or 15.
    Whenever an ace is valued as 11, the top total is always referred to as a "soft" total, so in the example, the 15 It would be a "soft 15". Players can request an extra card, or "ask for a card", or fold a soft hand without risk of going bankrupt.
    However, a soft hand is no guarantee of improvement after asking for a letter.
